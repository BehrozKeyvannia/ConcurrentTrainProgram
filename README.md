# ConcurrentTrainProgram
A application in Java which resolves two trains trying to get to two different train stations. 
The trains use the same program, concurrently, as they try to get to the stations avoiding collisions. 


UPDATE: the train simulator does not work anymore due change of a specifik file in Chalmers server.
